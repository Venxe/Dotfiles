This repository contains my personal dotfiles for setting up a customized Hyprland environment on Arch Linux. Hyprland is a dynamic tiling Wayland compositor that provides a modern, lightweight, and efficient experience.

## ⚙️ Installation
Run the following command in the terminal to download and install the Hyprland dotfiles:
